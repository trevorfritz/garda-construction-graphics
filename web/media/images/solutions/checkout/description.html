Consumers today want an increasingly high level of service with freedom of choice, simplicity and flexibility when they visit a store. There is low acceptance 
of passively waiting in queues, and this creates dissatisfaction. At the same time, stores are becoming more complex and there is a growing need for value-adding, 
service-driven activities.

Taken together, this is increasingly demanding a flexible checkout area a high level of efficiency, so that the staff can focus on service, the important element, 
instead of transactions. We have chosen to call this area the Checkout Arena. A retail chain may currently spend 3%-5% of its sales revenue on staffing its Checkout 
Arena. We can help reduce the cost by 30%-70% – and also increase the perceived service level.

Every year, ITAB’s checkout systems handle over 50 billion transactions, which have given us considerable experience of a wide range of store environments.
