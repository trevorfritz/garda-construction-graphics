<b>An ideal turnstile for loss prevention in retail stores</b>

<p>
This is a four-arm turnstile that provides entry access and pedestrian directional control in public environments. The curved arm design provides an impediment to pedestrians attempting to duck under the turnstile arms in the wrong direction. The turnstile rotates in one direction in either the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction.
