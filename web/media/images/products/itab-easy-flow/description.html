<b>Fully automatic, barcodeless self-scanning</b>

<p>
Meet the world’s first checkout that identifies products itself. It recognises more than 99% of items for what they are, not just what the barcode says. EasyFLOW replaces both conventional checkouts and other self-scanning solutions. With ITAB Match™ technology, EasyFLOW is able to determine what actually passes through the scanning tunnel, including items that the customer packs such as fruit, vegetables and bread.
